This includes handling permissions and any potential errors during file selection.\n\n3.  **JSON Parsing and Data Handling:** Once the file is selected, the app needs to read and parse the JSON data. The `processJsonData` function should be checked to ensure it correctly handles the imported data and updates the DOPE cards accordingly.\n\n4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch any issues during file selection, JSON parsing, or data processing.

The `calculateTotalScore` function respects the `markersIncluded` state\n4. The button text changes dynamically based on the state\n\nHowever, looking at the user's request, it seems like they want to ensure that the button only performs the action when clicked, and that it properly toggles between the two states. The current implementation appears to already do this correctly.\n\nLet me check if there are any issues with the current implementation by examining the `calculateTotalScore` function more closely:\n\nThe current logic in `calculateTotalScore` is:\n```javascript\n// Determine which shots to include based on markersIncluded state\nconst scoresToCalculate = markersIncluded ? validScores : validScores.slice(2);\n```\n\nThis means:\n- When `markersIncluded` is `true`: All valid shots are included\n- When `markersIncluded` is `false`: Only shots from index 2 onwards (Shot 3-12) are included, excluding Shot 1 and Shot 2\n\nThe button text logic is:\n```javascript\ntext={markersIncluded ? \"Remove Markers\" : \"Add Markers\"}\n```\n\nThis means:\n- When markers are included, the button says \"Remove Markers\"\n- When markers are excluded, the button says \"Add Markers\"\n\nThe `toggleMarkers` function:\n```javascript\nconst toggleMarkers = () => {\n  const newMarkersIncluded = !markersIncluded;\n  setMarkersIncluded(newMarkersIncluded);\n  console.log(`Markers ${newMarkersIncluded ? 'included' : 'excluded'} from score calculation`);\n  \n  // Recalculate score with new marker status\n  calculateTotalScore(shotScores);\n};\n```\n\nThis correctly:\n1. Toggles the state\n2. Logs the action\n3. Recalculates the score\n\nThe implementation looks correct and should work as requested. However, let me check if there might be any issues with the button placement or styling that could be causing confusion.\n\nLooking at the current implementation, everything appears to be working correctly according to the user's requirements. The button:\n\n1. Shows \"Remove Markers\" when markers are included\n2. Shows \"Add Markers\" when markers are excluded  \n3. Only performs the action when clicked\n4. Updates the score calculation accordingly\n5. Provides visual feedback about the current state\n\nThe implementation is already complete and functional.

The current implementation appears to be correct based on the code analysis. \n\nHowever, let me double-check the user's request to make sure I understand it correctly. The user wants:\n\n1. When the button says \"Remove Markers\" - clicking it should remove Shot 1 and Shot 2 from the score calculation\n2. After clicking, the button should change to \"Add Markers\" \n3. When the button says \"Add Markers\" - clicking it should include Shot 1 and Shot 2 back in the score calculation\n4. The button should only perform the action when clicked (not automatically)\n\nLooking at the current implementation, this is exactly what it does. However, let me make sure the implementation is crystal clear and add some additional logging to help with debugging.

I have successfully created a comprehensive login page for your Rifle Range Logger app using Supabase authentication. Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## \u2705 **Features Implemented:**\n\n### **1. Login Page Design**\n- **Same image and name**: Uses the exact same target image and \"Rifle Range Logger\" title as your home screen\n- **Clean UI**: Matches the existing app design with consistent styling and colors\n- **Responsive layout**: Works well on both iOS and Android with proper keyboard handling\n\n### **2. Authentication Features**\n- **Email & Password Login**: Users can sign in with their email and password\n- **User Registration**: New users can create accounts with email verification\n- **Password Reset**: Forgot password functionality with email reset links\n- **Form Validation**: Proper validation for email format and password requirements\n\n### **3. Supabase Integration**\n- **Authentication Database**: Uses Supabase's built-in authentication system\n- **User Profiles**: Created a profiles table with RLS policies for future user data\n- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling and persistence\n- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented\n\n### **4. Error Handling**\n- **Credential Validation**: Shows appropriate error messages for invalid credentials\n- **Network Errors**: Handles connection issues gracefully\n- **User Feedback**: Clear success and error messages with proper alerts\n\n### **5. Navigation & State Management**\n- **Protected Routes**: Users are automatically redirected to login if not authenticated\n- **Session Persistence**: Login state is maintained across app restarts\n- **Logout Functionality**: Added sign out button on the home screen\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **Technical Implementation:**\n\n### **Database Setup**\n- Created `profiles` table with proper RLS policies\n- Automatic profile creation trigger when users sign up\n- Secure user data handling with foreign key constraints\n\n### **Authentication Flow**\n- Email verification required for new accounts (redirects to `https://natively.dev/email-confirmed`)\n- Proper session management with AsyncStorage\n- Automatic navigation based on authentication state\n\n### **UI/UX Features**\n- Toggle between Sign In and Create Account modes\n- Password reset functionality\n- Loading states for all authentication actions\n- Consistent styling with your existing app theme\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **How to Use:**\n\n1. **New Users**: Click \"Create Account\" to register with email and password\n2. **Existing Users**: Enter email and password to sign in\n3. **Forgot Password**: Click \"Forgot Password?\" to reset via email\n4. **Sign Out**: Use the \"Sign Out\" button on the home screen\n\nThe authentication system is now fully integrated with your Supabase project and ready to use.
